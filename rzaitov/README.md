## A review of the code
Rustam Zaitov and Artem Mostalenko (U. St. Petersburg) kindly reviewed chapters 1 to 5 of the resource. They actually re-wrote some of the code in a more consistent and efficient Python style. Their new code is included here.

With time, we may transition to Rustam and Artem's code, although we still want to keep some similarity with the code in Allmendinger et al. (2012).

Anyway, this is a nice example of collaboration that leads to code improvement. Thanks to Rustam and Artem for spending time on this on a voluntary basis.
