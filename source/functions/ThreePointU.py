def ThreePointU(p1,p2,p3):
	'''
	ThreePointU calculates the strike (strike) and dip (dip)
	of a plane given the east (E), north (N), and up (U)
	coordinates of three non-collinear points on the plane
	
	p1, p2 and p3 are 1 x 3 arrays defining the location
	of the points in an ENU coordinate system. For each one
	of these arrays the first entry is the E coordinate,
	the second entry the N coordinate, and the third entry
	the U coordinate. These coordinates have uncertainties
	
	NOTE: strike and dip are returned in radians and they
	follow the right-hand rule format. The returned
	uncertainties are also in radians

	ThreePointU uses functions CartToSphU and Pole
	It also uses the uncertainties package from
	Eric O. Lebigot
