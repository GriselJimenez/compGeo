		normal traction on the plane (row 1), zero shear
		traction (row 2), and max. shear traction (row 3)
	dCTT = 3 x 3 matrix with the direction cosines of unit
		vectors parallel to: normal traction on the plane

	NOTE = Input stress tensor does not need to be along
		principal stress directions
		Plane orientation follows the right hand rule
