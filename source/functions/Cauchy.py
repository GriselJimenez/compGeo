	Given the stress tensor in a X1X2X3 coordinate system,
	Cauchy computes the X1X2X3 tractions on an arbitrarily
	oriented plane 

	USE: T,pT = Cauchy(stress,tX1,pX1,tX3,strike,dip)

	stress = 3 x 3 stress tensor
	tX1 = trend of X1
	pX1 = plunge of X1
	tX3 = trend of X3
	strike = strike of plane
	dip = dip of plane
	T = 1 x 3 vector with X1, X2 and X3 tractions
	pT = 1 x 3 vector with direction cosines of pole
		to plane with respect to X1X2X3

	NOTE = Plane orientation follows the right hand rule
	Input/Output angles are in radians

	Cauchy uses functions DirCosAxes and SphToCart
